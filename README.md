# Naive Bayes Spam Filter for Text Messages

The goal of this model is to classify individual text messages as either "spam" or "ham" based on their contents. A Naive Bayes model will be used for this task. Predictions are made based on the probability of words belonging to each class. The model will be trained using the data in `train.csv`. To evaluate the accuracy of the model, predictions will be made on the test data set found in `test.csv`.

## Run

Use python3 to run `naive_bayes_filter.py`. The accuracy of the classifier on the test set will be printed upon completion.
